# ScreenCord ðŸŽ¬

Lightweight macOS screen recorder that produces efficient, compressed video files.

## Why ScreenCord?

macOS built-in screen recording creates **bloated files** - a 30-second recording can easily be 118MB or larger. ScreenCord uses ffmpeg with optimized H.264 encoding to create **much smaller files** with the same quality, perfect for sharing and storage.

## File Size Comparison

| Recording Method | Duration | File Size |
|-----------------|----------|-----------|
| macOS built-in | 1 minute | ~118MB |
| **ScreenCord** | **5 minutes** | **~35MB** |


## Quick Install

```bash
curl -o screencord.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quamejnr/screencord/main/screencord.sh && chmod +x screencord.sh
```

## Requirements

- macOS
- ffmpeg: `brew install ffmpeg`

## Usage

```bash
./screencord.sh
```

The script will:
1. Show available video devices (cameras, screens)
2. Show available audio devices (microphones)
3. Let you select which devices to use
4. Start recording with native notifications
5. Save timestamped MP4 files to `~/Documents/`

### Custom Format

By default, the recording is saved as an `mp4` file. You can pass an argument to specify a different format.

For example, to save as a `mov` file:

```sh
./screencord.sh mov
```
